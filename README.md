# Platform-Base-Framework
I have done a base framework to my projects so i decided to make it public since there aren't many frameworks like those for Game Maker. 

If maybe you wanna port to another GameMaker such as GameMaker Studio 1.4, you need to make sure to change the sound_play from the rmTest room creation code to audio_play_sound and 
also change the audio system to the new system in the global game settings.
